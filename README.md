My notes on the article 'Phylogenetic diversityâ€“ecosystem function relationships are insensitive to phylogenetic edge lengths' by Marc W. Cadotte

## Usage

 * To download the needed files: in a terminal, type `./Download.sh`

Then run the script `Script.R`.

This produces the following figure:

## Other files

The file `fec12429-sup-0002-Suppinfo.txt` is the original file supplied with the original article.

## Work in progress

`Script.R` is a slight modification of the original script file, due to an error. 
I emailed Marc and he cordially supplied a first improvement and will supply the final fix as well.
